Aws :
    We create a function (Even SmallPiece of Micro service) like -> GetSecPrice,
                            Calculate Volatility, generateFile

        We store it AWS Storage
        Then a request comes for that function ->
                AWS check the config, gets the function and load it AWS COMPUTE
                    At this point the function is actually be running as an instance.
                One function is done AWS will destroy the function

        Another Good use case is Our Scheduler , we hav file gerneation based on Spring BOOT Scheduler
            Here this service runs 24/7
            Rather this Config it it AWS Lambda and let AWS handle it.
