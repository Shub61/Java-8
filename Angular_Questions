                     usually, it M(Model) V(View) VM (View Model) --> M V VM

2: Differentiate between AngularJS vs Angular ?
               AngularJS (1.x) :  Angular (2 Onwards)
Language       JavaScript      : TypeScript
Architecture   Controller      : Component
LazyLoad       No      : Yes

3: What are directives in Angular ?
        Helps to attach Behaviour in HTML DOM.
        Angular Syntax's written Inside HTML.

4: Explain the different types of Angular directives ?
        3 Types:
            Structural : Change the Structure of DOM element by adding/removing elements.
                    *ngIf, *ngFor : bcoz based on these Elements may be more and less.
            Attribute  :  It will always be in DOM, but based on behavior
                            It can be Hidden/Visible ; Highlighter. [hidden]
            Component  :  It's a Directive with Template. User Control.
                            basically (View + Logic)


5: Explain the importance of NPM and Node_Modules folder ?
        NPM is a package manger to install any Java Script Framework.
        node_modules is a folder where all packages Installs.

6: Explain the importance of Package.json file in Angular ?
        All the packages which project uses will be listed down to this file.

7 :- What is typescript and why do we need it ?
        It Adds the Type to Java Script. U can get Compile  Time Error
        Also, it provides OOPS. in easy way.

8 :- Explain importance of Angular CLI ?
        Help to give you ready made Angular project to Start with.
            Like SpringInitializer for SpringBoot.

9 :- Explain the importance of Component and Modules ?
        Component:  In this write Code which bind b/w View & Model. So basically central point.
        Modules:  It Groups the Angular Component.

10 :- What is a decorator OR ANNOTATIONS OR METADATA in Angular ?
        Tells what Exactly what Type of this Class

Variations of this qs:
        Create the Module/Component.
            Use @Component /@NgModule

12 :- What is a template ?
        It is the View HTML.
            2 ways U can define :
                Inline :- In ur component provide the template:  <USE HTML CODE>
                Outside:  In ur component provide the templateURL :  <USE PATH to HTML>

12 :- What is Data Binding
        How the View and Component Talk to each Other is Binding.

13 :- Explain the four types of Data bindings in Angular ?
        1: Expression/Interpolation binding -> {{}}   (Data flows from Controller to View)
        2: Property binding  ->  [] = some variable   (Data flows from Controller to View)
        3: Event binding  ->  (click)   (Data flows from View to Controller)
        3: Two Way binding  ->  [(ngModel)]   (Data flows from View to Controller and Vice Versa)

14 :- Explain architecture of Angular ?
        1 View/Template Talks to Controller/Component
        2: Controller/Component
        3: Modules (Group of Components)
        4: Bindings For View b/w Components
        5: Directives
        6: Service (Some Common Functionality)
            Services are INJECTED in Components. using Dependency Injection

15 :- What is SPA in Angular ?
        Single Page Application
            where common parts are loaded once
                and then depending on user events dynamic sections are loaded from server.

16 :- How to implement SPA in Angular ?
        Using Routing
17 :- How to implement routing in Angular ?
        Helps you to navigate for ur App
            Home: will navigate to HomeComponent and that will invoke view.
        Step 1: Use a collection where all navigation are stored.
        Step 2: In Html define <[routerLink] = "Home"> Home </a>
        Step 3: In Html have one <router-outlet></router-outlet>

18 :- Explain Lazy Loading ?
19 :- How to implement Lazy Loading in Angular ?
        Step 1: Divide the App into Modules
        Step 2: Use loadChildren in Routing Collection

22:- How to implement Dependency Injection ? (Services are used)
        use providers property from NgModules Annotations

23 :- Differentiate between ng Serve and ng build ?
        ng serve : build in ONLY in Memory
        ng build : build like PROD, store in disk  under dist folder

26 :- Explain ViewChild and ViewChildren?
        To refer View element in Component use ViewChild('div1', MORE...)
        To refer View collections (which are present in view via single variable)

27 :- Why do we need Template reference variables?
        To paas the View Element value or element itself to Component as a Method Argument.
        We create this <input #myinput type ="text>

28 :- Angular LifeCycle
        2 Steps:
            One time Event Chains
                Constructor ->
                      ngOnChanges ->
                      ngOnInit ->
                      ngDoCheck ->
                            ngAfterContentInit ->
                            ngAfterContentChecked ->
                            ngAfterViewInit ->
                            ngAfterViewChecked->
                      ngOnDestroy
            Every change Events
